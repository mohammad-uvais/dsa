/**
 * The size of the queue is fixed and a single block of memory is used as if the first element is connected to the last element.
 * Also referred to as the circular buffer or ring buffer and follows the FIFO principle.
 * A circular queue will reuse the empty block created during the dequeue operation.
 * When working with queues of fixed maximum size, a circular queue is a great implementation choice.
