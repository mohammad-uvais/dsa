// Stack is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principal of LIFO
// The last element inserted into the stack is the first element to be reomved
// Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behaviour rather than being a mathematical model
// The stack data structure supports two main operations
// -- push, which adds an element to the collection
// -- pop, which removes the most recently added element from the collection

// Stack usage
// browser history tracking
// undo operation when typing
// Call stack in JS runtime
