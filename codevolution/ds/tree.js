/**
 * A tree is hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges
 * A tree is a non linear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures
 * In linear DSs, the time required to search is proportional to the size of the data set
 * Trees however, owing to the nonlinear nature allow quicker and easier access to the data
 * A tree will not contain any loops or cycles.
 */

/**
 * Tree Usage
 *
 * File systems for directory structure
 * A family tree
 * An organisation tree
 * DOM
 * Chat bots
 * Abstract syntax trees

// Note -  Like linked lists, trees are something asked about during interviews

/**
 * Binary Tree
 *
 * A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children
 * They are referred to as left child and right child
 */

/**
 * Binary Search Tree
 *
 * The value of each left node must be smaller than the parent node
 * The value of each right node must be greater than the parent node
 * This is in addtion to each node has at most two children
 */

/**
 * Binary Search Tree Operations
 *
 * Insertion - To add a node to the tree
 * Search - To find a node given its value
 * DFS & BFS - To visit all nodes in the tree
 * Deletion - To remove a node given its value
 */

/**
 * Binary Search Tree Usage
 *
 * Searching
 * Sorting
 * To implement abstract data types such as lookup tables and priority queues
